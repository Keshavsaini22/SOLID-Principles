It’s a specialized, stronger form of association that models a "whole-part" relationship.
Aggregation represents a "has-a" relationship between two classes, where one class (the whole) groups or organizes other classes (the parts), but does not control their lifecycle.

Key Characteristics of Aggregation:
1.The whole and the part are logically connected.
2.The part can exist independently of the whole.
3.The whole does not own the part.
4.The part can be shared among multiple wholes.
5.Both the whole and the part can be created and destroyed independently.

Key Difference
Association → Just a connection (no ownership).
Aggregation → Whole–Part (weak ownership, but parts are still independent).
