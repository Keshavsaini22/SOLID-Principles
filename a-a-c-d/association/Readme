Association represents a relationship between two classes where one object uses, communicates with, or references another.
This relationship answers the question:
“Does one object need to know about the existence of another object to perform its responsibilities?”

Key Characteristics of Association:
1.Association reflects a "has-a" or "uses-a" relationship.
2.Associated objects are loosely coupled and can exist independently of one another.
3.The association can be unidirectional or bidirectional, and can follow different multiplicity patterns (1-to-1, 1-to-many, etc.).
