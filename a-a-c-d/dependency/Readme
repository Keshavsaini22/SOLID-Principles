If class A uses class B just to perform a task—not to store or own—that’s a dependency.

A Dependency exists when one class relies on another to fulfill a responsibility, but does so without retaining a permanent reference to it.

This typically happens when:
A class accepts another class as a method parameter.
A class instantiates or uses another class inside a method.
A class returns an object of another class from a method.


Key Characteristics of Dependency:
Short-lived: The relationship exists only during method execution.
No ownership: The dependent class does not store the other as a field.
"Uses-a" relationship: The class uses another to accomplish a task, but does not retain it.
