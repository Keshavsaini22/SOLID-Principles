O&C P- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

The Open/Closed Principle dictates that once a module is complete and tested, you shouldnâ€™t have to modify it to add new features. Instead, you extend its behavior via abstraction (e.g., inheritance, interfaces, or composition).

Why OCP Matters:
1.Stability: Existing code remains unchanged and trusted.
2.Flexibility: New functionality is added by extending, not modifying.
3.Reduced Regression: Less risk of breaking existing features.
4.Scalability: Systems can grow more gracefully as requirements evolve.


Practical Steps to Apply OCP-
Identify Variations: Determine where behavior might change or grow.
Use Abstractions: Define interfaces or base classes for variable behavior.
Leverage Composition/Inheritance: Inject or subclass concrete implementations.
Write to Interfaces: Depend on abstractions rather than concrete classes.
Test Extensions Independently: New strategies can be tested without touching existing code.
