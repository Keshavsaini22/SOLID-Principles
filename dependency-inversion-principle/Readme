DIP - This principle holds that high-level modules, i.e., the modules that contain strategic decisions and high-level directives, should not depend on low-level modules, which are the modules that contain detailed and low-level logic.

The Dependency Inversion Principle consists of two key rules:
High-level modules (business logic) should not depend on low-level modules (utility classes); both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).
Abstractions should not depend on details; details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.

Why DIP Matters:
Flexibility: Swap implementations without modifying high-level code.
Testability: Mock or stub abstractions in unit tests.
Decoupling: Reduces coupling between modules, making the system easier to evolve.
Maintainability: Changes in low-level details donâ€™t ripple upward.

Practical Steps to Apply DIP:
Identify Dependencies: Spot where high-level modules directly instantiate or import concrete classes.
Define Abstractions: Create interfaces or abstract base classes for these dependencies.
Refactor to Injection: Pass implementations into constructors or setters (Dependency Injection).
Implement Concrete Modules: Have concrete classes implement the abstraction.
Use Test Doubles: Inject mock or stub abstractions during testing instead of real implementations.
